# MIIII - Mechanistic Interpretability of Irreducible Integer Identifiers

MIIII exploring the properties and interpretability of prime number representations in attention-based neural networks.
The goal is to gain insights into these fundamental building blocks of mathematics through computational analysis and modeling.
Prime numbers are a fundamental concept in mathematics, and understanding their properties can lead to insights into the nature of computation and intelligence.
Questions one might ask about prime numbers include:

- [x] Are there an infinite number of prime numbers?
- [ ] Can every number be expressed as a product of prime numbers?
- [ ] What is the distribution of prime numbers?
- [ ] is $p$ a prime number?
