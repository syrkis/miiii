# MIIII - Mechanistic Interpretability of Irreducible Integer Identifiers

MIIII is a project exploring the properties and interpretability of deep prime number (irreducible integer) identifiers.
The goal is to gain insights into these fundamental building blocks of mathematics through computational analysis and modeling.
