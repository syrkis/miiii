# Mechanistic Interpretability on Irreducible Integer Identifiers

Training neural nets to do prime related tasks, of varying complexity.
Transformers are used to as model architecture. Table of contents:

- [Tasks](#tasks)
- [Mechanistic Interpretability](#mechanistic-interpretability)

## Structure

- `src/data.py` contains data generation functions for the different tasks.
- `src/model.py` contains the transformer model.


## Tasks

- Division.
- Classification. (is a given number prime?)
- Continuation. (what is the next prime after a given number?)
