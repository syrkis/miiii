# TODO

- [ ] compare to baseline, and other models / papers (decide metrics)
- [ ] Grokking (research of grokking is possible for prime numbers)
- [x] setup hpc   <-  working on this
- [x] extensive logging (wandb)   <- work on this now
- [x] add layernorm.  <-  working on this
- [x] add dropout to model
- [x] make switch between prime and ficciones trivial
- [x] write on paper
- [x] add dropout
- [x] split and evaluate tasks into test, train and eval

- [ ] add paper and notes to repo
- [ ] hilbert / hinton plot of weights
- [x] run RASP successfully.
- [ ] Replace learned circuit with RASP implementation?
