# TODO

- [x] modify output layer to indicate divisibility by all sqrt(n) numbers
- [ ] replicate @nanda2023  <- working on this
- [ ] make test set with numbers larger than n, but same number of digits
- [ ] compare to baseline, and other models / papers (decide metrics)
- [ ] Grokking (research of grokking is possible for prime numbers)
- [ ] add paper and notes to repo
- [ ] hilbert / hinton plot of weights
- [ ] Replace learned circuit with RASP implementation?

- [x] use fastgrok
